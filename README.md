# code-refactor

This code-refactor repository contains the Horiseon digital marketing services webpage from the Code Refactor assignment. The webpage has been updated to adhere to accessibility standards. Updates have also been made to the index.html and style.css files to ensure semantic html is used and that the CSS code is consolidated to reduce redundancies.
